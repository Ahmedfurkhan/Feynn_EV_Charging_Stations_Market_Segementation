## **EV Charging Infrastructure Analysis**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, using a dataset containing information on charging station locations, vendor distribution, station types, and payment methods. The analysis covers:

- **Geographical Distribution**: Identifies disparities in charging station availability between urban and rural areas.
- **Vendor and Station Types**: Highlights the dominance of key vendors and the prevalence of fast-charging stations.
- **Payment Accessibility**: Evaluates the diversity and inclusivity of payment methods at charging stations.
- **Visualizations**: Includes maps, heatmaps, and correlation plots to illustrate key findings.
- **Key Recommendations**: Suggests expanding infrastructure in underserved areas, promoting vendor competition, and integrating emerging technologies like ultra-fast charging and renewable energy sources.

### **Conclusion**
The analysis underscores the importance of strategic investment and policy support in ensuring the EV charging infrastructure keeps pace with the rapidly growing EV market, ultimately contributing to a sustainable transportation future.
